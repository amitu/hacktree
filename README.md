## How to Get Started

To create your personalized Link-in-Bio page, follow these simple steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. In the `bios` folder, create a new file named `your-name.ftd` using the `template.ftd` file as a reference. Please ensure that your filename contains no whitespace or special characters (except for -, _), and update the placeholders in the file with your own information.
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR).
4. Once your PR is merged, your fastn-powered Link-in-Bio page will be live! Happy hacking!

Feel free to extend and customize your page further to make it uniquely yours.
